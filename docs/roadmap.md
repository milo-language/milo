# Milo Roadmap

## Completed

### Core Language

The foundation is complete: primitive types, let/var bindings, if/else, while/for loops, functions, structs, enums with pattern matching (exhaustiveness checked), generics with monomorphization and type inference, move semantics with use-after-move detection, second-class references (`&T`/`&mut T` in params only), closures (including escaping/move closures), traits with static dispatch and `@derive(Eq)`, operator overloading via traits, `Heap<T>`, `Option<T>`, `Result<T,E>` with `!`/`?`/`??` operators, string interpolation, bitwise operators, hex/binary literals, type casts, for-in loops over ranges/Vec/array/string/HashMap, HIR-based typed IR, and Go-style interfaces with structural typing and vtable-based dynamic dispatch.

### Type System & Safety

- **Ownership**: single-owner move semantics, compiler-tracked drops, no GC
- **Null safety**: `Option<T>` — no null pointers in safe code
- **Race safety**: `Send`/`Sync` traits — compiler rejects data races at `spawn()` boundaries
- **Overflow safety**: compile-time range checks + debug-mode traps via LLVM overflow intrinsics
- **No implicit coercion**: explicit `as` casts only
- **Ranged integers (L1+L2)**: `type Altitude = i32(0..50000)` with range propagation through arithmetic

### Concurrency

Green-tier concurrency with one OS-thread escape hatch:

- **Green threads** (`std/runtime`): stackful coroutines via ucontext (64KB stacks, guard pages, kqueue/epoll), cooperative scheduling, transparent async I/O — `stream.recv()`/`stream.send()` auto-yield on EAGAIN
- **Promises** (`std/runtime`): `Promise<T>.run()`, `.await()`, `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()` — structured concurrency over green threads
- **Task API** (`std/runtime`): `Task.spawn()` for fire-and-forget lightweight concurrency
- **`Promise.blocking()`** (`std/runtime`): the one OS-thread escape hatch — CPU-bound work or blocking FFI, `Send`-checked captures, result via `await`
- **Synchronization** (`std/sync`): `Channel<T>` (bounded FIFO, multi-producer, blocking + non-blocking), `WaitGroup`, `select`, `AtomicI64`, `AtomicBool`
- **No async/await**: write normal blocking code — it yields automatically in green thread context
- Public `Thread`/`Mutex`/`RwLock`/`parallel` removed 2026-07-10 (green-tier only; re-add on demand — see concurrency-simplification.md)

### Standard Library (44 modules)

I/O & system: io, fs, path, env, args, process, signal
Networking: net, http, url
Data: json, csv, toml, base64, hex, sqlite, arena, set
Concurrency: thread, sync, runtime, event
Strings: string, fmt, strconv, unicode, regex
Math: math, random, sort
CLI: argparse, color, log
Crypto: crypto
Time: time, datetime, uuid
Testing: testing
Memory: mem

### Developer Experience

- **LSP server**: diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, completions, code lens
- **VS Code extension**: syntax highlighting + LSP client
- **Formatter** (`milo-fmt`): context-sensitive formatting, LSP integration (written in Milo)
- **Package manager** (`milo-pkg`): init, new, add, install, git-based cache with lockfile (written in Milo)
- **Test framework**: `@expect:`/`@error:` annotations, `milo test` runner
- **Example apps**: web servers (7), CLI tools (jq, grep, rg, cat, wc, tree, calc, hex, timeout, fmt)
- **GitHub Actions CI**: build + test on push/PR, release pipeline
- **Playground**: browser-based compiler via JS backend (in progress)

### Self-Hosting — Bootstrap Converges

`milo0` (`src-milo/`, ~8.2K lines) — the Milo compiler written in Milo — compiles its own source and reaches a **byte-identical fixed point at the production `-O2` level**: `stage1 == stage2 == stage3`, 157K-line IR identical. Manifest-wide, 212/339 fixtures emit byte-identical IR between stage1 and stage2, zero divergences. See **[docs/self-hosting.md](self-hosting.md)** for the full milestone log (M0–M5) and the eight oracle miscompiles the self-compile exposed and fixed.

Reproduce: `sh scripts/selfhost.sh` (builds stage1 via the oracle — required; `.selfhost/milo-self.bin` is gitignored), then `bun test tests/selfhost.test.ts`.

Remaining (M6, incremental): grow the manifest toward full fixture parity. Expected gaps are the constructs bootstrap doesn't need — closures, user generics, traits beyond `impl Clone`, threads/green-runtime.

## In Progress

### Self-Hosting — Stage-1

Blocking full milo0-on-milo0:

- [ ] `Vec<T>` in milo0 — 84 use sites, biggest blocker
- [ ] `String.push` in milo0 — needs mutation-through-self + realloc
- [ ] Port type checker, HIR, lower, codegen to Milo

End goal: compiler compiles itself, producing equivalent IR for the full Milo source set.

---

## Planned

### Runtime Maturity — `node-milo`

`node-milo` is the current stress test for Milo as an implementation language. If a missing feature keeps runtime logic in C++ or forces raw pointer arithmetic in Milo, it moves up the roadmap.

- [ ] Move more `internalBinding()` implementations out of C++ and into Milo
- [ ] Track success by Node compat %, shrinking C++ glue, and keeping `unsafe` contained to binding seams
- [ ] **V8 C API wrapper — eliminate bridge/*.cpp entirely**. Currently `bridge/core.cpp`, `bridge/fs.cpp`, `bridge/timers.cpp` (1235 lines of C++) exist solely because V8 has no C API — every binding must extract V8 args and return V8 values through C++ types (`FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>&`, `HandleScope`, etc.). The fix: write a single `v8_c_api.cpp` that wraps V8's C++ API in `extern "C"` functions (`v8c_get_string_arg`, `v8c_return_int`, `v8c_throw_error`, etc.), then `declare` those in Milo and move all binding orchestration into `.milo` files. This collapses the three-layer architecture (JS → C++ glue → Milo) into two layers (JS → Milo via V8 C wrapper). For reference, even bun (which uses JSC's C API from Zig/Rust) still has 153K lines of C++ — our 1.2K line bridge is already thin, but eliminating it makes the codebase purely Milo + one mechanical C wrapper.

### Safety Hardening

**Shipped 2026-07-16 — `--overflow-checks`.** `+ - *` trap at `-O0` but silently WRAP at
-O2/-O3: `i64::MAX + 1` quietly becomes `i64::MIN` in a release build (Rust's wart; Swift
traps in every mode). The flag turns traps on at any -O so the cost can be measured before
deciding the default. `tests/overflowChecks.test.ts` pins BOTH halves against `--release` —
it lives outside tests/runtime-errors/ because that harness compiles at `--debug`, where
overflow already traps, so a fixture there would pass whether or not the flag worked.
**Not yet the default**, and the benchmark to justify that is still owed: the compiler
proves most arithmetic safe and emits no check at all (`matmul` emits zero traps even with
the flag on), while arithmetic-dominated code with unprovable operand ranges measured
~+8% (0.37s -> 0.40s over 400M iterations). Real benchmarks are sub-0.3s and need a quiet
machine to measure credibly.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — a fixed-size array of Copy elements is now Copy** (Rust's
`[T; N]: Copy where T: Copy`). `[u8; 16]` — an IPv6 address — could not be passed to two
functions: the first call MOVED it, and the compiler's own hint said to "clone it at the
point of transfer", which arrays have no method for. The diagnostic named a fix that could
not be applied. The element check keeps it sound: `[string; 2]` still moves
(`tests/errors/arrayNonCopyMove.milo`), so two owners can't free the same heap. It does not
make big buffers copy by value either — `[u8; 4096]` decays to `*u8` at every call site in
std, and nothing passes a large array by value.

**Shipped 2026-07-16 — IPv6 in `std/net`.** `ip6("::1")` (16 raw bytes via `inet_pton`),
`TcpStream.connect6`, `TcpListener.bind6`, with `scopeId` for link-local peers. Added
ALONGSIDE the v4 API, not replacing it: `ip4()` returns a u32 and `connect(ip: u32, ...)`
bakes IPv4 into its signature, and a u32 cannot hold a 128-bit address. `AF_INET6` is 30 on
darwin / 10 on linux (verified) — one of the few socket constants that genuinely differs —
so it comes from the platform split. A v4 literal is NOT auto-mapped: `ip6("127.0.0.1")` is
None rather than a v4-mapped address, which is the trap that made node-milo's v4-only stack
appear to work. Verified by a real ::1 round-trip (`tests/fixtures/tcpIpv6.milo`).

**Shipped 2026-07-16 — `std/unix` (AF_UNIX stream sockets).** `UnixListener`/`UnixStream`
with the same shape as the TCP pair (green-aware `accept`/`connect`, `incoming()` channel,
`take()`), so a local daemon gets a filesystem-scoped transport instead of a localhost TCP
port. It needed the sockaddr seam first: the syscalls take `struct sockaddr *` and read the
family from its first bytes, so `bind`/`connect` cannot be declared per-family (the resolver
merges every decl of an imported file, so a second one at another type just loses). With
`std/os` declaring them raw against `*SockAddr` behind typed per-family wrappers, this module
holds no `unsafe` at all. A path longer than `sun_path` is rejected rather than silently
truncated into a different socket. See `tests/fixtures/unixSocket.milo`.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — a `&mut self` method on a match-bound COPY silently discarded the write.**
`match b { Box.Full(c) => { c.bump() } }` compiled, ran against a snapshot, and threw the
result away (inside `bump` v==2, after the match v==1) — while the identical operation
through a `&mut` fn arg was correctly rejected. The method receiver was the one path that
skipped `setAutoBorrowChecked`. Rejecting every copy-bound receiver is too blunt (it broke
six shipped programs); three things must line up for the loss to be observable: the binding
is by value (a ref writes through), the payload is Copy (a non-Copy payload is MOVED, so the
binding owns it), AND the subject is a place that outlives the arm. `match Child.spawn(...)
{ Ok(child) => child.closeStdin() }` is legal for the opposite reason — the subject is a
temporary, so the binding IS the owner. if-let and let-else share the binding path and are
covered. Fixtures pin both directions: `tests/errors/matchCopyBindMutate.milo` and
`tests/fixtures/matchTempBindMutate.milo`.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — `string.push(65)` needed an explicit `as u8`.** The arg was checked
with no expected type, so an int literal inferred i64 and then failed a u8 equality check;
`Vec.push` had always hinted its arg. Nothing else loosens: an out-of-range literal is
rejected by the coercion ("integer literal 300 overflows u8"), and a real i64 value is still
refused (`tests/errors/stringPushI64.milo`) — silently truncating that is the opposite of
the point.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — signal self-pipes were a single global, cross-wiring any program that
armed two signals.** `_sigPipeW` was one `i32`, so installing a second signal re-pointed the
shared handler at the second pipe: raising SIGWINCH made **SIGCHLD's** fd readable while the
resize fd stayed empty — a resize delivered as a child exit, silently. It survived because
nothing had ever armed two at once; `timeout` arming SIGCHLD while `splitPty` arms SIGWINCH
is what made the pair reachable. Now one write-end per signal, and the shared handler picks
the pipe from its argument (the only input a C handler gets). Out-of-range signals are
rejected instead of indexing off the table. `tests/fixtures/signalTwoPipes.milo` asserts both
directions — each signal hits its own pipe and only its own.

**Shipped 2026-07-16 — `timeout` waits on an event, not a 50ms poll.** Its loop was
`waitpid(pid, status, WNOHANG)` + `sleepMs(50)` — the last genuine I/O poll in the tree. Now
a `Select` over the SIGCHLD self-pipe fd and the deadline. Behaviour is identical (verified
case-by-case against the pre-change binary: exit code, timeout=124 in 1.04s not 5s,
`-k`, and signal-death — which returns 0 both before and after, because the child exits
*normally* after `system()` returns). Three hazards the conversion has to handle, all
documented at the call site: fd arms need a scheduler even with no green tasks
(`schedulerEnsureInit()`); the pipe must be installed BEFORE `fork` or a fast child's exit
is missed; and the handler plus its pipe write-end are **inherited across fork**, so the
child calls `resetSignal(sigchld())` before `system()` — otherwise its grandchild's exit
wakes the parent for the wrong death.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — a timer-only main-context `Select` spun forever (regression from the
same day's C1 fix).** The main wait loop polls the scheduler and re-checks the claim, but
`_schedulerRunOnce` returns early when `numTasks == 0` and only polls the event loop while
tasks remain. Select arms don't live on the task list — fd/timer arms hang off `sSelFdHead`
and are claimed by `_pollAndWake` — so once the last green task finished, the poll became a
no-op and the loop spun. Before C1 this returned `-1` immediately: wrong, but it terminated.
`_schedulerPollMainSelect` now polls the event loop directly when nothing is runnable
(`_selMinTimeout` bounds the sleep, so it blocks rather than busy-spins). Caught by building
the child-exit arm, not by the suite — `selectMainContext.milo` misses it because its task is
still alive when the claim lands. `tests/fixtures/selectTimerMain.milo` pins it.

**Shipped 2026-07-16 — child-exit `Select` arm.** No new API: `installSignalPipe(sigchld())`
+ `sel.onRead(fd)` + `waitpid(pid, buf, WNOHANG)`. The pieces just never existed at once —
SIGCHLD landed the same day, and WNOHANG is 1 on both platforms (verified). Unblocks the
event-driven `timeout` rewrite. See `tests/fixtures/selectChildExit.milo`.

**Shipped 2026-07-16 — a `Promise` can be armed in a `Select` (`p.channel()`).** The two
concurrency tiers didn't compose: `Promise` runs work on an OS thread, `Select` waits on the
green event loop, and an event-driven `timeout` wanted to bridge them. `Promise` always held
a `Channel<T>`; nothing exposed it. Handing it out is safe because `Channel<T>` is a single
`*u8` and therefore an implicitly Copy handle — it needs no `clone()`, and `let a = ch; let
b = ch` already alias (the old blocker checked for a `@copy` attribute rather than the
property). `await()` still owns the fetch.

That needed a third wait tier. With no scheduler (a main using only `Promise.blocking`)
there is nothing to park on and nothing to poll, so `SelectState` gained a condvar that a
foreign pthread's claim signals — the same ladder channels already use. **Timer and fd arms
are inert without a scheduler** (they need the poll loop), so `onTimeout` is not a safety
net there; `wait()` returns -1 for a select whose arms are all inert rather than blocking on
a wake that can never come, and mixed arms are not rescued. Documented at the top of
`std/select.milo`.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — `Select.wait()` returned `-1` instead of the winning arm on the main
context.** `schedulerCurrent()` is 0 there, so `schedulerPark()` no-opped and the unclaimed
`-1` fell straight through — select still woke at the right moment, so callers just couldn't
tell which arm fired and the demos drained every arm to compensate. Main now takes the shape
channels already use (`_schedulerPollMain`): it can't park, because nobody else would drive
the scheduler, so it polls a bounded tick and re-checks the claim. Green tasks still park.
`tests/fixtures/selectMainContext.milo` pins the arm index (a 5s timeout arm makes a stalled
poll fail on the index rather than hang the suite).

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — a closure's expected return type was never propagated.** Param hints
were, but not the return, so an un-annotated `() => 0` always inferred i64 and
`opt.unwrapOrElse(() => 0)` on an `Option<i32>` failed with "callback must return i32, got
i64". The caller's expected return now seeds the closure's body context (an explicit
annotation still wins; an `unknown` hint, as Vec.map gives, still infers from the body).
Caught by the language-reference doc test, which type-checks every `milo` block.

**Shipped 2026-07-16 — `Option.map` / `Option.unwrapOrElse`.** Both lower through `OptionOp`
with a real branch rather than the `select` that `unwrapOr` uses: `select` evaluates both
arms, so the callback would run even when it shouldn't — defeating the point of each. `map`
builds its result enum via `monomorphizeEnum("Option", [U])`, so `U` need not equal `T`
(`Option<i64>.map(n => n > 5)` gives `Option<bool>`). `map` takes the payload by `&T`, which
is why it needs no Copy gate, unlike `unwrapOr`/`unwrapOrElse` which load the payload out —
nothing is moved out of the receiver, so an owned inner can't gain a second owner. Fixtures
`optionMap.milo` / `optionUnwrapOrElse.milo` pin laziness via output ordering and cover the
non-Copy (`Option<string>`) case.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — `std/signal.onSignal` handed its handler a garbage signal number.**
It took `handler: (i32) => void`, i.e. a closure, whose code pointer takes `(env, sig)`. A C
signal handler has no user-data slot, so `signal()` called it with the signal number in the
env slot and the handler read garbage as its `sig` (1794499728 instead of 20). Nothing
caught it because the only in-tree handler, `_sigPipeHandler`, ignores its argument — so
SIGWINCH via `installSignalPipe` worked and the doc comment "Handler receives the signal
number" stayed false. Now takes a raw `*u8` fn pointer. Also added `SIGCHLD` — the one
signal here whose number differs per platform (20 darwin / 17 linux, both verified against
the real headers), so it lives in the `std/platform` split; `tests/fixtures/signalSigchld.milo`
asserts it by raising the signal rather than restating the number.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — variadic externs declared with the wrong fixed arity miscompiled
silently.** A libc fn like `fcntl(int, int, ...)` declared as `extern fn fcntl(fd, cmd, arg)`
compiles clean and calls with the wrong ABI: AArch64 passes variadic args on the stack while
a fixed-arity call puts them in registers, so the callee reads garbage. x86_64 hides it (the
conventions agree for integer args). node-milo lost hours to exactly this — `O_NONBLOCK`
never landed, so every socket stayed blocking and it presented as a throughput mystery.
The checker now compares each extern against libc's real fixed-param count
(`checkVariadicExtern`). It immediately found a live one in **our own std**: `execl` was
declared with 1 fixed param but C fixes 2 (`path`, `arg0`), so `std/process.spawn` handed
every child a garbage `argv[0]` and shifted the real one to `argv[1]` — observable as
`/bin/echo` echoing its own path. Covered by `tests/errors/variadicExternFixedArity.milo`.

**Fixed 2026-07-16 — `std/net` + `std/ws` TLS clients verified no certificates.** Both
called `SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths` and stopped: that loads the trust store but an
OpenSSL client defaults to `SSL_VERIFY_NONE`, so it was never consulted. A self-signed
cert that `openssl s_client` rejects handshook fine, and an attacker's cert for any host
satisfied `wss://` — a MITM was undetectable. Loading the CA store *looked* like
verification, which is why it survived. Now: `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` + `SSL_set1_host`
(hostname binding — SNI selects the server's cert, it verifies nothing) +
`SSL_get_verify_result`. Covered by `tests/tlsVerify.test.ts`, whose hostname case holds
the chain valid so it can only fail on the hostname.

See **[docs/safety-roadmap.md](safety-roadmap.md)** for the full plan. Summary:

1. `unsafe` blocks — quarantine FFI and low-level code behind a grep target
2. Flow-sensitive invalidation tracking — catch aliased mutation at compile time (ref-while-frozen, use-after-invalidate, arena scope tainting)
3. Interprocedural exclusivity — reject aliasing `&var` + `&` at call sites, purity inference, arena lifetime scoping
4. Dynamic fallback — debug ref counting and sanitizer mode for patterns static analysis can't reach
5. Safety profiles — `default`, `strict` (aircraft-grade), `performance`
### Language

Runtime pressure from `node-milo` changes the order here: binary data and FFI safety land before more expressive abstractions.

- [x] ~~**Safe extern call expansion**~~ — extern calls no longer need `unsafe` when all args are safely coerced (string→`*u8`, array→`*T`, `*T`→`*T`, `fn`→fn ptr) and return is scalar/void. Dramatically reduces `unsafe` in FFI code.
- [x] ~~**`string.cstr()` builtin**~~ — returns `*u8` data pointer without `unsafe`. Replaces `_strDataPtr` intrinsic for ergonomic C string interop.
- [x] ~~**Opaque foreign handle types**~~ — `extern type sqlite3`, `extern type SSL` — opaque types that can only exist behind `*T`. Prevents handle mixups between different FFI types. No LLVM layout emitted.
- [x] ~~**Pointer-to-struct field access**~~ — `ptr.field` auto-derefs `*Struct` for field access (requires `unsafe`). Eliminates manual byte-offset pointer arithmetic for C struct access.
- [x] ~~**Typed function pointers in extern decls**~~ — extern fns accept `(*u8, *u8) => i32` params directly. Passing a Milo function no longer needs `as *u8` cast.
- [x] ~~**CStr stdlib**~~ — `std/cstr.milo` provides `CStr.wrap(ptr)`, `.toString()`, `.byte(i)`, `.eq()` for safe NUL-terminated C string access.
- [ ] **Unused import warnings** — compiler should warn (or error) on imported symbols that are never used in the module. Currently `main.milo` imports all binding symbols just so they link, but ideally re-exports or `pub` declarations in binding modules would handle this without polluting the import list.
- [ ] **Borrowed slices / byte views** — `&[T]` / `&mut [T]`, with slicing generalized beyond `string`. Unblocks offset/length I/O, `Buffer`/`ArrayBuffer` interop, and zero-copy protocol parsing.
- [ ] **C ABI / layout control** — packed structs, alignment control. `extern struct` and `sizeOf`/`offsetOf` already work.
- [x] ~~**`@cLayout` — extern struct layout verification**~~ — a declared `extern struct` layout was taken on faith; a wrong offset silently read the neighbouring field and returned plausible garbage. `@cLayout("struct timespec", "time.h")` now emits a throwaway C TU asserting each field's `offsetof` **and** `sizeof` against the real header, compiles it with the system `cc` at build, and discards it. Size checked `>=` so prefix decls stay legal; skipped for bare-metal. Opt-in, and hand-written `extern fn` decls remain unchecked; `unsafe` deliberately covers neither (tracks provenance, not layout/effects). Stepping stone to a full `@cImport`. See `~/git/node/src/milo/MILO_PAINPOINTS.md` #8.
- [ ] **Structured OS / syscall errors** — `OsError`/`SysError` carrying `errno`/code plus syscall/path context. Needed for runtime bindings, better diagnostics, and Node-compatible error surfacing.

- [x] **Interfaces (runtime polymorphism)** — Go-style interfaces with structural typing and vtable dispatch. `interface Shape { fn area(self: &Self): f64 }` — any type with matching methods satisfies the interface. Separate from traits (which remain compile-time only).
- [ ] **Heap\<Interface\> + heterogeneous collections** — `Vec<Heap<Shape>>` for mixed-type collections via heap-allocated interface values.
- [ ] **Iterators** — iterator trait, `.map().filter().collect()` chains, lazy evaluation. Needs associated types.
- [ ] **Error conversion** — `From` trait for automatic error conversion in `?`, `anyhow`-style boxing.
- [ ] **Ranged integers L3** — branch narrowing: after `if x < 50`, x is known `(min..49)` in the then-branch.
- [ ] **MIR** — lower-level IR for optimization passes (post self-hosting)

### Standard Library

- [x] ~~**JSON streaming / pull parser**~~ — shipped: `jsonPull(src).next()` yields `JsonToken`s (`StartObject`/`Key`/`Str`/`Num`/…/`End`) via a container-stack state machine, never building the tree — O(depth) memory (cf. Go `json.Decoder.Token`). Reuses `jsonSkipWs`/`jsonScanStringRange`/`jsonMaterializeStr`. Still string-backed; incremental byte-feed (true unbounded stream) is a later layer on the same tokenizer.
- [ ] **JSON builder ergonomics** — the *read* side is clean; constructing a document by hand (`jsonObj().str(k,v).int(k,n).build()` chains) is clunky vs the fluent parse API. Flagged from Hades. Wants nicer literal/builder sugar for the write path.

### Tooling

- [x] ~~**LSP: rename + find references**~~ — shipped: `textDocument/references`, `documentHighlight`, and `rename`, plus workspace-wide search over every `.milo` under the workspace root. Name-based like hover/goto (not scope-resolved), which is fine for the read-only ones. Rename is the exception — it WRITES, so params/locals are confined to their enclosing function in their own file; only top-level names get the workspace-wide replace. Before that, renaming `a` in `fn f(a)` also rewrote the unrelated `a` in `fn g(a)`.
- [ ] **Doc comments + generation** — `///` comments, `milo doc` to generate HTML/markdown
- [ ] **Cross-compilation** — `--target aarch64-linux` etc. (infrastructure exists in target.ts, needs CLI flag + sysroot handling)
- [~] **Windows port** — *core works and is CI-verified; the async/IOCP tier does not.* `getHostTarget()` used to fall through to the Linux entry for any non-darwin host, so Windows silently claimed `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and emitted ELF-targeting IR — it didn't fail, it lied. `windows-x64`/`windows-arm64` are now real targets (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`), and CI's `windows-latest` job runs **the fixture suite itself** — the great majority compile and run as native PEs on real Windows (was 401/441; this pass resolved the process/`CreateProcess`, `environ`/`sysinfo`, `std/crypto` hashing, ConPTY, and blocking-socket tiers, shrinking the skip list further — CI is the authority on the exact count). The remaining `// @skip-os: win32` fixtures carry the reason inline, so the skip list is the remaining port work, item-by-item, rather than a number in a doc; the per-tier state is below. See [breaking-changes.md](breaking-changes.md) for the `std/os` → `std/platform` relocation this required.
  - [x] **target + link** — COFF via `lld-link`, `.exe` suffix, no `-lm` (the UCRT has no separate libm and `lld-link` treats it as a hard error, not a no-op), `bcrypt`/`ws2_32` auto-linked from the SDK when their symbols appear.
  - [x] **CRT divergence** — `print` lowers to `_write` (32-bit count, LLP64), `eprint` and the assert/bounds paths to `fprintf(__acrt_iob_func(2), …)`: MSVC has no `dprintf` and no linkable `stderr` symbol.
  - [x] **win64 struct ABI** (`abi.ts`) — Microsoft x64, not System V: a struct rides in one integer register **only** at size 1/2/4/8, everything else by pointer, no HFA rule. Before this, struct-by-value externs silently returned garbage (`externStructLarge` gave 4294967297001 for 1001) instead of failing to link.
  - [x] **platform arms** — `platform`, `event`, `random`, `term`. Constants were read out of Microsoft's headers by compiling a probe against the SDK, not inferred: `AF_INET6` is 23 (vs 30 darwin / 10 linux), `_stat64` is 56 bytes (vs 144), `sockaddr_in` has no `sin_len`, and the open flags need `_O_BINARY` or the CRT rewrites `\n`→`\r\n`.
  - [x] **pthreads → Win32** — all 17 moved into the platform split and implemented over `SRWLOCK`/`CONDITION_VARIABLE`, so `std/sync` and `std/runtime` stay single-source.
  - [x] **green scheduler** — ucontext over `CreateFiber`/`SwitchToFiber` (the runtime reads its context layout through `uctxSize()`/offsets, so the Windows arm defines its own), `mmap` over `VirtualAlloc`, `gettimeofday`/`usleep` over `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime`/`Sleep`, `getentropy` over `BCryptGenRandom`.
  - [x] **dev loop** — cross-compile from macOS/Linux with `xwin splat` + `MILO_WINDOWS_SDK`, sweep every fixture under Wine with `bun scripts/windows-sweep.ts`; CI's `test-windows` job is the authority on real-OS execution.
  - [ ] **IOCP async tier** (14 fixtures) — the expensive one, and not a translation: kqueue/epoll report *readiness* ("ready, go read"), IOCP reports *completion* ("the read you started finished"), so `std/runtime` restructures around completion. Until then `eventPoll`/`eventRegisterRead` abort with a named message, and green IO on a non-socket fd refuses rather than deadlocking (`ioctlsocket` is sockets-only, so without that guard `read` blocked the scheduler thread forever with no output).
    - *Scope confirmed this pass:* the fiber scheduler itself already runs on Windows — `greenThreadMany` prints `spawned 1000` before it dies, `selectChannelVsTimeout` prints `recv 42`. Every one of the 14 then aborts in the **same** place: the scheduler's central wait calls `eventPoll`, which is the inert stub. So this is one seam, not fourteen — even the pure-channel and pure-timer fixtures route their park/wake through it.
    - *Design sketch for the next pass:* the readiness API (`eventRegisterRead(fd)` → later `eventPoll` says "fd ready" → task does the `read`) inverts to: a green `read` issues an **overlapped** `ReadFile`/`WSARecv` with an `OVERLAPPED` whose key identifies the parked task, then yields; the scheduler's wait becomes `GetQueuedCompletionStatus(hIOCP, …)`, and a returned completion packet carries the byte count and the key, so the scheduler resumes that task with the result already in hand (no second syscall). Fds/sockets are associated once via `CreateIoCompletionPort(handle, hIOCP, key, 0)`. Timers fold in through the `GetQueuedCompletionStatus` timeout argument (the `select`-vs-timeout fixtures), and cross-thread park/unpark through `PostQueuedCompletionStatus`. The `read`/`write`/`recv`/`send` call sites in `std/io`/`std/net` move from "set non-blocking + register + retry on EAGAIN" to "start overlapped + park + resume on completion"; that is the restructure, and it is real work, not a stub swap.
  - [~] **Winsock** (5 fixtures) — **primitives done, blocking sockets work.** `ensureNetInit()` (→ `WSAStartup`, a no-op on POSIX) runs before any socket; `netErrno`/`netEagain`/`netEinprogress` fold to `WSAGetLastError`/`WSAEWOULDBLOCK` on Windows and to `errno`/`EAGAIN` on POSIX; `closeSocket()` routes to `closesocket` (a Windows SOCKET is **not** a CRT fd — `_close` on one trips the CRT fastfail). `socketBind` unskipped and verified under Wine. **Still gated:** (a) the non-blocking connect/recv error checks are only exercised on the green-IO path, which needs the IOCP tier; (b) `std/net` proper cannot link on Windows because it bundles `TlsStream`, whose `SSL_*` symbols need an OpenSSL built for the target sysroot (`xwin` ships the CRT and SDK, not third-party libs) — decoupling TLS into `std/tls` would let non-TLS net link, but the sockets still need IOCP to run. The **type-width problem** remains: `socket`/`accept` return `SOCKET` (`UINT_PTR`, 8 bytes) but `std/os` declares them `i32`; `closeSocket` widens at the boundary, but the fd-carrying layer is still i32, so `scripts/audit-extern-returns.ts` correctly flags it and stays off the Windows CI job until the layer goes i64.
  - [x] **`fork`/`waitpid`/`kill`** → `CreateProcess` (`std/process.windows.milo`). No fork semantics to emulate: a process is created whole, waited on through its HANDLE, killed with `TerminateProcess`. Pipe redirection wires `_pipe` fds inheritable-per-end (a wrong `_O_NOINHERIT` combination trips the CRT invalid-parameter fastfail — `0x8080`, not `0x8180`). A missing program is reported by `spawn()` up front, not by `wait()` as on POSIX. `processPipe`/`processPipeExecFail` made portable via `@targetOs()`; verified under Wine.
  - [x] **`std/environ` + `std/sysinfo`** — `GetEnvironmentStringsA` (double-NUL block), `GetSystemInfo`/`GlobalMemoryStatusEx`/`GetComputerNameA`/`GetTickCount64`. POSIX-only concepts (uid/gid/ppid/loadavg) degrade to the same zero/empty the POSIX arms return on failure, never a fabricated value. Unblocks `examples/terminal/sysmon.milo` (once `std/pty` links).
  - [x] **`std/crypto`** → CNG / `bcrypt.dll` (no OpenSSL needed): `sha256`/`sha1`/`md5` via `BCryptHash` versioned pseudo-handles (one-shot, no provider open), digests verified against known vectors under Wine. `stdCrypto`/`cryptoSha1` unskipped. **AES-GCM still fails loud** — CNG's `BCryptEncrypt` + `BCRYPT_AUTHENTICATED_CIPHER_MODE_INFO` path (GCM-chained key, wide-string chaining-mode property) is the remaining piece; `cryptoAesGcm`/`wsBasic` stay skipped.
  - [x] **`std/pty`** → ConPTY (`CreatePseudoConsole` + a `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE` proc-thread attribute list on `STARTUPINFOEX`). `COORD` is packed as an i32 (ABI-identical in a register). `slavePath` is `""` — there is no pts device. Open/spawn/wait/resize/close verified under Wine (`ptyLifecycle.milo`, portable via `@targetOs()`). Caveat: a ConPTY output pipe does **not** EOF on child exit the way a pts does (its conhost keeps the write end), so a read-to-EOF loop must be driven by `output()` + `wait()`; the two POSIX-pts-specific fixtures stay skipped.
  - [ ] **`std/regex`** (1) — no C-linkable regex exists on Windows (`<regex.h>` is absent, `std::regex` is C++-only), so `std/regex.windows.milo` is a **fail-loud arm** for now: the surface links so cross-platform code compiles, and any use aborts with a named message. The real fix is a **pure-Milo regex engine**, which would also let every platform drop the libc dependency — its own tracked piece of work.
  - [x] **`std/os` fd calls were wrong on Windows** — found by running the c-decl guards natively for the first time. `read`/`write` linked through the UCRT oldnames shim to `int _read(int, void *, unsigned int)` while `std/os` declared 64-bit count and return; Win64 leaves the upper half of RAX undefined for an `int` return, so a `-1` could arrive as a large positive `i64`. Fixed the right way: `read`/`write`/`open`/`close`/`lseek`/`access` (and `getpid`, `dlopen`/`dlsym`/`dlclose`/`dlerror`) moved into the platform split, where the file name states the C library. The Windows arm binds `_read`/`_write`/`_lseeki64` at their true widths and widens once; `std/dl` runs on Windows now (`LoadLibrary`/`GetProcAddress`). See [breaking-changes.md](breaking-changes.md).
  - [x] **cross-target C decl verification (Windows)** — `verifyCDecls` used to skip on every target≠host cross, so the `@cLayout`/`@cSig` guards that catch LLP64 mistakes (`long` is 4 bytes on Windows, 8 everywhere else) were absent cross-compiling — which is exactly how the `ADDRESS_FAMILY` include-order bug reached CI instead of a local build. Now a Windows cross with `MILO_WINDOWS_SDK` set compiles the guard TU with `--target=<triple>` against xwin's headers (correct LLP64 model), so those guards run on the dev host. Other target≠host crosses still skip, announced (no sysroot to read).
  - [ ] **non-portable fixtures** — `dateTimeLocal` declares its own POSIX `setenv`; the struct-ABI C peers used `long` where they meant `int64_t` (fixed). These are test-side portability bugs, not compiler gaps.
  - [ ] **examples** — SDL2 is itself cross-platform, so the emulators may come nearly free once the base exists.
- [ ] **Benchmarking** — `@bench` annotations, `milo bench` runner
- [ ] **Documentation / tutorials / "the book"**

## Known Bugs

- [x] ~~**Missing `linkonce_odr` linkage**~~ — fixed: all non-main functions now emit `define linkonce_odr`, eliminating duplicate symbol errors when the same monomorphized generic or prelude function appears in multiple compilation units.
- [x] ~~**Duplicate symbol errors from prelude**~~ — resolved by `linkonce_odr` fix above.
- [x] ~~**No module-level state**~~ — fixed: `let` and `var` at module scope now work everywhere. Parser, checker, lower, and codegen all handle `GlobalDecl` nodes. Emitted as LLVM `internal global`. Supports int/float/bool literal initializers.
- [x] ~~**Large array codegen crash (>=65536 bytes)**~~ — fixed: aggregate types (arrays, structs) no longer fall through to the scalar trunc/ext cast path in genCast.
- [x] ~~**Codegen: `break`/`continue` skip drop cleanup**~~ — fixed: break and continue now emit `emitLoopDropGlue()` for loop-local owned values before branching. All 6 loop variants (while, for-range, for-each vec/string/array/hashmap) track `loopDropStart`.
- [x] ~~**No `string` → `*u8` cast**~~ — fixed: `"literal" as *u8` and `myString as *u8` now work in unsafe blocks. Codegen extracts the data pointer from the String struct.
- [x] ~~**`string` not coercing to `*u8` in all positions**~~ — fixed: string→`*u8` coercion now works in let/var declarations, assignments, and return statements, in addition to function call arguments.
- ~~**Variadic ABI corruption on ARM64**~~ — investigated: variadic support already implemented (parser, AST, codegen all handle `...`). Not a bug.

## Missing Stdlib Bindings

- [ ] **`execvp`** — needed for tools that exec subcommands with argument arrays (timeout, xargs, env). Currently must route through `system()` which double-forks through `/bin/sh`.
- [ ] **`alarm` / `setitimer`** — enables signal-based timeouts without polling loops
- [ ] **`setpgid` / `killpg`** — process group control for proper job management in tools like timeout
