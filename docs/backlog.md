# Backlog — prioritized

A **do-next ordering** across the open work. Status source of truth is [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); this file only ranks by return-on-investment vs effort. `Ref` links the canonical entry.

**Shipped items are deleted from this file, not struck through** — git history and roadmap.md keep the record. If an entry ships but leaves real work behind, only the leftover survives here, rewritten as its own item.

ROI / Effort: **H**igh / **M**edium / **L**ow. Tiers = the quadrant that matters: ship Tier 1 first (cheap + high payoff), invest deliberately in Tier 2, let Tier 3 wait.

## Tier 1 — quick wins (high ROI, low effort) — do first

| # | Item | ROI | Effort | Why / unblocks | Ref |
|---|------|-----|--------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | **Extern decls: params unverified; audit is host-only** | M | M | `scripts/audit-extern-returns.ts` now checks **157** of 215 scalar-returning `extern fn`s against real headers — libc plus openssl/sqlite3/mach/CommonCrypto (probed, used when present) — and **std is clean**, so mass-annotating with `@cSig` finds nothing. Still unchecked: (a) **parameters** — needs a C parser; `@cSig` doesn't cover them either; (b) the 58 skipped, nearly all pointer/void returns (no width is claimed); (c) it reads the **host's** headers, so `std/*.linux.milo` is unverified from a mac — the remaining yield is a Linux run. | `scripts/audit-extern-returns.ts` |
| 1b | **`@cLayout` can't describe synthetic padding fields** | M | M | node-milo's `Rusage` pads with `_p0.._pD` so the struct is big enough for `getrusage` to write 144 bytes — fields that don't exist in C. `@cLayout` emits `offsetof(struct rusage, _p0)` and fails, so that struct can't be verified at all. Wants a way to say "check the first N fields, then trust the size" — the prefix rule already exists for the tail, just not for opaque padding. | `~/git/node/src/milo/bindings/process.milo` |
| 2 | **`@cLayout` is opt-in and undiscoverable** | M | L | Nothing tells you an unannotated `extern struct` is unverified, so the hole stays open by default. Options: warn on `extern struct` without `@cLayout`, or infer the header for well-known libc types. | `src/checker.ts checkCLayout` |
| 2c | **`verify.ts` misattributes unsupported constructs** | L | L | A contract the SMT translator has no arm for (`IfExpr`, `MatchExpr`, `IsExpr`, and 13 more) becomes `(UNSUPPORTED IfExpr)` and reports **`unknown — outside linear fragment`**. Sound (never a false `proven` — checked), but the message blames nonlinearity for a perfectly linear contract, sending you to optimize the wrong thing. Say "translator has no rule for IfExpr" instead. | `src/verify.ts exprToSmt` |
| 2b | **Cross-compiling hosted targets needs a sysroot** | M | H | `--target` now reaches clang and a cross build fails loudly with a hint (was: silently emitted a host binary and reported success). Actually *doing* it needs a target linker + sysroot; the compiler has no `-I`/`-isysroot`/`--sysroot` notion at all. Until then, build on the target. Also what blocks cross-target `@cLayout`/`@cSig` verification, which warns and skips. | `src/main.ts clangTargetFlags`, `linkIR` |
| 3 | **Struct-field + fn docstring pass** on hot modules | M | L | Bare 6502 register fields (`a/x/y/p`) and un-doc'd fns (`busRead`) read as opaque to newcomers. One-line labels close it. Also seeds `milo doc` (Tier-2). | — |
| 4 | **`std`-shadows-local fix** | M | L→M | A local can be silently shadowed by a std symbol. Correctness + clarity. | memory: papercuts-from-hades |
| 5 | **`src-milo/` is unformatted** (24 of 25 files) | L | M | The formatted-source gate covers `std/` + `tests/fixtures/` (0 dirty); the self-hosted compiler was never run through `fmt`, plus 3 under `examples/` and 5 under `tests/errors/`. Reformatting `src-milo/` wants the selfhost byte-identity tests (`scripts/selfhost.sh`) watched, so it's its own change. Then widen `corpus()`. | `tests/fmtCorpus.test.ts` |
| 6 | **Unused import warnings** — *deferred, not loop-sized* | M | M | Resolver strips imports (`resolveImports` returns `imports: []`), so the checker never sees them — needs threading entry-file imports + used-name collection across resolver→checker, **and** still false-positives on node-milo's link-only imports. Wants a real design pass. | roadmap.md:108 |

## Tier 2 — strategic (high ROI, higher effort) — plan & invest

| # | Item | ROI | Effort | Why / unblocks | Ref |
|---|------|-----|--------|----------------|-----|
| 7 | **Iterators** — `.map().filter().collect()` | H | H | Ergonomics everywhere; kills manual index loops. Needs associated types. | roadmap.md:115 |
| 8 | **Doc comments + `milo doc`** | H | M | `///` + generator. DX + real docs; incentivizes the docstrings #3 adds by hand. | roadmap.md:123 |
| 9 | **LSP rename + find-references** | H | M | Daily-driver DX gap. | roadmap.md:122 |
| 10 | **Byte views for I/O interop** | H | M | Vec/string/array slicing all shipped. Remaining: generalized byte views for I/O/`Buffer`/`ArrayBuffer`. Unblocks the zero-copy form of #11. | roadmap.md:109 |
| 11 | **JSON incremental byte-feed** | H | M | `jsonPull` shipped (string-backed). Remaining: incremental feed for unbounded input (socket/multi-GB) — a reader layer over the same tokenizer. Hands out copies until #10 lands. | roadmap: Standard Library |
| 12 | **Option `map`/`unwrapOrElse`** | M | M | `isSome`/`isNone`/`unwrapOr` shipped (`unwrapOr` gated to Copy inner). Remaining needs closures; plus `?`-on-Option polish. | memory: papercuts-from-hades |
| 13 | **Flow-sensitive invalidation tracking** | H | H | Compile-time catch of aliased mutation / use-after-invalidate — the aircraft-grade safety tier. | roadmap.md:94, safety-roadmap.md |
| 14 | **Compile-time reduction** | H | H | Broad DX win; diffuse, needs profiling first (candidate for MIR). | memory: papercuts-from-hades |

## Tier 3 — backlog (niche, deferred, or lower ROI)

Track in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); pull up when a concrete need appears.

- **`JsonObj.build()` returns `string`, not `Json`** — read/write paths disjoint; bridge later (`std/json.milo`)
- **Error conversion** — `From` in `?`, boxing (roadmap.md:116)
- **Ranged integers L3** — branch narrowing (roadmap.md:117)
- **Heap\<Interface\>** — heterogeneous collections (roadmap.md:114)
- **C ABI layout control** — packed structs, alignment (roadmap.md:110)
- **Structured OS/syscall errors** — `errno` + context (roadmap.md:111)
- **Struct-by-value FFI stage 6** — define-side exported struct-by-value fns (memory: struct-by-value-ffi)
- **`-O2` codegen blowup + int-widening** — deferred from emulator work (memory: emulator-feedback-fixes)
- **Missing bindings** — `execvp`, `alarm`/`setitimer`, `setpgid`/`killpg` (roadmap.md:143-145)
- **MIR** — optimization IR, post self-hosting (roadmap.md:118)
- **node-milo V8 C API wrapper** — eliminate `bridge/*.cpp` (roadmap.md:87)
- **Cross-compilation**, **benchmarking harness**, **"the book"** (roadmap.md:124-126)
- **Promise / shuf ergonomics** — verify current status before scheduling (memory)
- **Re-enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`** — off deliberately 2026-07-16 so the tsc gate could enforce at zero; it was a bun-init default with ~700 violations, i.e. enforcing nothing. Retrofitting means ~700 `arr[i]!` assertions, which silence rather than prove. Revisit per-file only if index bugs actually show up. (`tsconfig.json`)
- **`@derive` on enums** — enums parse attributes but nothing consumes them; now a hard error rather than a silent no-op. Implement if wanted (`checker.ts processDerives` walks only structs).

## Concurrency & TUI findings (2026-07-15, tmuxClone/splitPty session)

Surfaced building a terminal multiplexer (`examples/apps/tmuxClone.milo`) — the
primitives carried it, but these gaps are where the friction was. Ranked.

| # | Item | ROI | Effort | Detail | Ref |
|---|------|-----|--------|--------|-----|
| C1 | **`Select.wait()` returns `-1`, not the winning arm** | H | M | Main-context select parks correctly (idle CPU **0.0%**) but the claim never lands in the return value, so callers can't tell *which* arm fired. Workaround in the demos: drain every arm (correct + free, fds are `O_NONBLOCK`). Root cause is in the main-thread vs green-task park/claim path (`_selectWaitState`/`_wakeSelectFds`); `schedulerCurrent()` is 0 on the main context so `schedulerPark()` no-ops. **Attempted fix** (drive `_pollAndWake` from `_selectWaitState` when no current task) **regressed to a hang**. Needs a proper investigation of who unparks the main select task. | `std/runtime.milo:795` |
| C2 | **Concurrency primitives don't compose** | H | M | `Promise` is not selectable and `Channel<T>` has no shareable handle / `clone()` (`_ptr` is module-private, not `@copy`). So you can't bridge a `Promise.blocking` OS-thread result into a `Select` — exactly what an event-driven `timeout` needs. Want: `Channel.clone()` (or a selectable `Promise`), **plus** a child-exit `Select` arm (SIGCHLD / kqueue `EVFILT_PROC`). | `std/sync.milo:210`, `std/runtime.milo:486` |
| C3 | **`timeout.milo:247` is a `waitpid(WNOHANG)`+sleep poll** | M | M | The one genuine I/O-poll left after the sweep (animation demos are frame timers, correctly untouched). Clean conversion is **blocked on C2**. | `examples/cli-tools/timeout.milo:247` |
| C4 | **Blocking `waitpid` wedges the green runtime** | M | M | Blocking `waitpid` on a `SIGKILL`'d-but-wedged child (stuck writing to a full PTY) hangs the scheduler thread. Now handled inside `Pty` (kill → close master to unwedge → reap), but the runtime interaction is a sharp edge worth a guard. | `std/pty.*.milo` |
| C5 | **No SIGWINCH → resize needs a timer** | M | M | No signal→`Select` arm, so TUI resize is polled (`splitPty` uses `onTimeout(500)`). A signal arm would make it fully event-driven. | `examples/apps/splitPty.milo` |
| C6 | **Papercuts** | L | L | (a) match-bound values are immutable for `&mut` **fn args** but fine for `&mut` **methods** — inconsistent, forced inlining a spawn helper. (b) `string.push` needs an explicit `as u8` on int literals. | session |
| C7 | **No `AF_UNIX` in `std/net`** | M | M | `std/net` is TCP-only. The tmux-style detach/attach daemon works over a localhost TCP port as a result — fine on one machine, but a unix-domain socket (filesystem-scoped, no port allocation, peer-cred auth) is the right transport for a local daemon. Add `UnixListener`/`UnixStream`. | `std/net.milo`, `examples/apps/tmuxDaemon.milo` |

**Known limitation (not a bug):** on split/resize the daemon rebuilds every pane grid at the new width (shells repaint via SIGWINCH), so on-screen content of *other* panes is cleared at that moment (still live in each shell's own history). True content reflow across a resize is a later polish.

## Ergonomics findings (2026-07-16, ugly-code audit)

| # | Item | ROI | Effort | Detail | Ref |
|---|------|-----|--------|--------|-----|
| E2 | **Named enum-variant fields** | H | M | `ForEach(string, Option<string>, TypeKind, Option<TypeKind>, Heap<HIRExpr>, string, Vec<Heap<HIRStmt>>, Option<Span>)` needs a trailing comment decoding the slots. Hits the self-hosted compiler hardest (HIR/AST are all sum types). Rust-style `ForEach { varName: string, ... }`. | `src-milo/hir.milo:88` |
| E1 | **Raw-pointer sugar: `ptr == null` + `ptr.offset(n)`** | M | L | Null check today is `dir as i64 == 0 as i64` (both sides cast); pointer arithmetic is `(ctBuf as i64 + outLen as i64) as *u8` (three casts). Recurs across `fs`/`cstr`/`env`/`runtime`/`sync`/`crypto`. Confined to the FFI seam, but the ugliness is accidental, not deliberate friction. | `std/fs.milo:97` |
| E3 | **Type-alias hygiene sweep** | M | L | Language has `type X = ...`; `std/` + `src-milo/` use it zero times. `&Option<Vec<Heap<Stmt>>>` is spelled verbatim ~30× — one `type Block = Vec<Heap<Stmt>>` kills it. Pure code debt. | `src-milo/checker/stmt.milo:189` |
| E4 | **Codegen context struct** | M | M | `locs/sigs/retTy` + 4 label params copy-pasted through every `gen*` fn (13-param signatures). Fold into a `GenCtx`. | `src-milo/codegen/stmt.milo:205` |
| E5 | **`jsonParseValue` err flag → `Result`** | L | L | Parser threads `err: &mut bool` through 3 signatures instead of `Result<i64, E>` — predates typed-errors migration. Scratch-vec design itself is deliberate zero-alloc, keep it. | `std/json.milo:964` |

## Dependency notes

- **#10 (byte views) gates the zero-copy form of #11 (streaming JSON).** #11 works without it (materialize per event), but hands out copies until #10 lands.
- **#3 (hand docstrings) → #8 (`milo doc`):** do #3 opportunistically now; #8 makes it systematic.
- **#14 (compile time) likely wants MIR (Tier 3)** for real wins — profile before committing.
