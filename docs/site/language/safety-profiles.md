# Safety profiles

Safety-critical domains have coding standards that restrict what language features are allowed. Milo can check your code against these standards at compile time.

```bash
milo safety flight_controller.milo --safety=do178c-a
```

## Available profiles

```bash
milo safety --list
```

| Domain | Standard | Profiles | Governs |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Avionics | DO-178C | `do178c-a`, `do178c-b`, `do178c-c` | Airborne software (DAL A–C) |
| Automotive | ISO 26262 | `iso26262-a` through `iso26262-d` | Vehicle ECUs, ADAS (ASIL A–D) |
| Spacecraft | NASA-STD-8739.8 | `nasa-a`, `nasa-b` | Flight software (Class A–B) |
| Industrial | IEC 61508 | `iec61508-3`, `iec61508-4` | Nuclear, rail signaling (SIL 3–4) |
| Medical | IEC 62304 | `iec62304-a`, `iec62304-b`, `iec62304-c` | Device software (Class A–C) |

## What gets checked

Each profile is a combination of constraints, tuned to the standard's requirements:

| Constraint | Description | Strictest at |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| No recursion | Direct self-calls banned | DO-178C A, IEC 61508 SIL 4 |
| Bounded loops | `while` loops must have `invariant` clauses | DO-178C A, NASA A |
| No dynamic allocation | No Vec, String, HashMap construction | IEC 61508 SIL 4 |
| Require contracts | All functions need `requires`/`ensures` | DO-178C A, NASA A |
| No floating point | Integer-only arithmetic (no `f32`/`f64` in signatures, locals, casts, or literals) | IEC 61508 SIL 4 |
| No recursive types | Self-referential types banned even through `Heap<T>`: recursive data has unbounded traversal depth | DO-178C A, IEC 61508 SIL 4 |
| Max call depth | Longest static call chain bounded (call graph is a DAG since recursion is banned) | IEC 61508 SIL 4 (max 20) |
| Complexity limit | Cyclomatic complexity cap per function | IEC 61508 SIL 4 (max 15) |
| No unsafe blocks | `unsafe { }` banned entirely | All profiles |
| Full match coverage | All `match` arms required (enforced by the type checker's exhaustiveness pass) | Most profiles |
| Used results | A discarded `Option`, `Result` or `@mustUse` result (the `unused-result` warning) is an error | DO-178C A–C, NASA A–B |

Each violation is reported as an error naming the profile:

```
  error: [do178c-a] function 'processInput' must have requires/ensures contracts
  error: [do178c-a] function 'processInput' contains recursion (banned at this safety level)
  error: [do178c-a] while loop in 'processInput' must have an invariant clause for bounded execution
```

## Integrating with CI

Add safety checking to your build pipeline:

```bash
milo safety src/controller.milo --safety=do178c-a || exit 1
```

The command exits with code 1 if any errors are found, making it suitable for CI gates.
